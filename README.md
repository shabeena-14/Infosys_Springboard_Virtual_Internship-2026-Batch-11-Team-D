ElectViz is an interactive election data visualization project built using Power BI to transform large election datasets into easy-to-understand dashboards. It helps analysts, media, and the public explore voting patterns, party performance, seat distribution, and regional trends through clear, data-driven visual insights.
# Project title 
Electviz election  data visualization for  media    ElectViz is an interactive data visualization project designed to analyze, interpret, and present election data in a clear and engaging way. Developed using Power BI, this project transforms large-scale election datasets into intuitive dashboards that help analysts and users gain meaningful insights into party performance and seat distribution.
The project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can simplify complex election data into clear visual stories, supporting better understanding of political outcomes.
# Project overview
ElectViz is a multi-page Power BI dashboard developed to analyze historical election data spanning several decades. The dataset contains information related to election year, state, party affiliation, vote counts, vote share, candidates, and seat allocation.
The dashboard enables:
* Macro-level analysis (national trends)
* Meso-level analysis (state and party comparisons)
* Micro-level analysis (candidate performance)
Through interactive filters and visual elements, ElectViz supports exploratory analysis and informed interpretation of electoral patterns.
